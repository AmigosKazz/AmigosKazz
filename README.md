#### Hey there! 👋
I am a generalist. I am most engaged when working on hard problems that I have not yet wrapped my brain around.

Sometimes I think I’ve forgotten how to have fun. Still, I find many ways to waste my time by dissociating and not being able to enjoy the present.
I have lots of issues I’ve never dealt with or come to terms with, that mostly come from some severe PTSD. I used to think it was just the way I had to build myself to survive and then live, and in some ways it is true. There are also things I became that I don’t really like and have become more and more tired of over the years. 

</br>

By day, I’m a backend developer who also works on frontend tasks (though less frequently).
I’m less interested in the code itself than in what happens behind it.
My real passion lies in system design and data structures & algorithms (DSA).
I enjoy designing systems, designing API, choosing architectures, and picking design patterns to solve problems; but I don’t always enjoy writing all the code to implement them.
I sometimes wonder if I can truly call myself a developer, but I am one.
Btw I work at a startup and really enjoy being part of my team.

Thanks for dropping by! Have an awesome day :)
