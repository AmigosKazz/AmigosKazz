#### Hey there! 👋
I’m in love with a silent companion a **rubber duck** , the one thing that understands all of me, listens endlessly, and never judges.

By day, I’m a web developer; lately I’ve been curious about _low-level stuff_, just to peek under the hood.
But the real magic? My team: [2RK dev](https://github.com/2RK-dev). _We chill, We wrestle with DSA problems, We code together_. Honestly? They’re the best squad I could ask for.

<br>

Outside code? I’m all about small joys (good food, random walks watch anime, playing video game or anything that keeps my brain happy). Life’s better when you know how to enjoy it.

Thanks for dropping by! Have an awesome day :)
